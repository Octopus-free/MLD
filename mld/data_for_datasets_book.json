  "iris": "This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. (See Duda & Hart, for example.) The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.",
  "wine": "These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines. I think that the initial data set had around 30 variables, but for some reason I only have the 13 dimensional version. I had a list of what the 30 or so variables were, but a.) I lost it, and b.), I would not know which 13 variables are included in the set.",
  "poker hand": "Each record is an example of a hand consisting of five playing cards drawn from a standard deck of 52. Each card is described using two attributes (suit and rank), for a total of 10 predictive attributes. There is one Class attribute that describes the Poker Hand. The order of cards is important, which is why there are 480 possible Royal Flush hands as compared to 4."
